  <h2>My Strength</h2>
  <em>A fast learner, dedicated and fantastic</em>
  <ul>
    <li>My strength lies in my resilience, my determination and ability to pick myself up and keep going even when things get tough.</li>
    <li> I am also passionate about learning and am always looking to expand my knowledge and skills. I have a strong work ethic and am committed to excellence in everything I do. I am an excellent problem solver and enjoy tackling difficult tasks. </li>

  <h2>My Hobby</h2>
  <p>My hobby is doing animation. I love coming up with creative storylines and characters, and then bringing them to life with animation. I enjoy learning different animation techniques, such as traditional hand-drawn animation, computer-generated animation, and stop-motion animation. I also find it rewarding to work with a team to create an animated project, as it is a great way to collaborate and learn from others. Creating animation is a fun and fulfilling way to express myself, and I am always looking for new ways to explore this fascinating art form.</p>
